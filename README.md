## 🧪 Testing with Jasmine

This project uses the Jasmine testing framework to ensure functionality and correctness.


***Jasmine was used for unit testing core functionalities such as***:

- 🛒 Cart updates

- 📦 Order tracking logic

- ✅ DOM interactions

Test files are located in the /tests folder.

***To run tests:***

Open tests.html in your browser

Or run with a Jasmine test environment

**Why Jasmine?**

Jasmine is a powerful behavior-driven framework for testing JavaScript code, and it doesn’t require a DOM or external dependencies.
